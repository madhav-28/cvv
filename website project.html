 Blogging, in today world in which there are tons of sources to make money. But blogging is still one of the best methods of making money.
 Actually I considered Blogging as one of the best sources due to many reasons -:
</ol>
<ul>
 <li> <em>Blogging is best </em> because it is very - very easy to start Blogging . Literally you can start writing your first own Blog in just
    2 minutes with the help of <strong>Blogger.com</strong>(By the way it is the product of GOOGLE)</li> 
    <br>  
    <li><em>Blogging is best</em> because you can write your bol from anywhere. No matter where you are at you toilet or travelling in a train 
        YOU can start writing. Beacuse in other option like youtube, teaching online etc. you have to record a video.and you also have to lot of 
        things . But is blogging you only have to write a blog , and if you want a professionl website to write your Blog . There is a website called
        <em>WORDPRESS</em></li>

        the work or projects on your own. As in Freelancing  you have to take specific projects from client (online) without interacting 
        physical and complete your project . And afterwords clients pay you. Actually you don't have to create your website as nowadays There
        are many website which work on the commision basis.As you can make your profile on these websites and according to your skill you can get
